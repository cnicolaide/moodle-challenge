# moodle-challenge
Deploying a moodle instance on Azure using GitHub Actions

## Directives 

1. Create a running Moodle instance on the cloud platform of your choice
* Web access must use https protocol
* Provide either a moodle user login or site admin and password
* Provide shell access
* Perhaps use AWS free tier, etc
* Not on MoodleCloud 
2. Document all steps and settings
* Even if not completely working, so we can understand logic followed
* No other passwords required to aws, etc - just the configuration details and credentials listed in point 1
* Provide all/any code used and documentation

**Bonus:** Automate the steps in building the system with whatever methodology and tools you are most comfortable using. FYI Moodle ICT uses Saltstack, Terraform and Python in AWS
